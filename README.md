# IoT Farm Management System

This IoT project utilizes ESP8266, Arduino Uno, and Firebase to create a smart farm management system. The system includes features such as gate control, lighting control, fire detection, soil moisture monitoring, and automated watering.

## Features

1. **Gate Control:**
   - Open/close the farm gate using the mobile app or manual switch.

2. **Lighting Control:**
   - Turn on/off farm lights remotely using the mobile app or manual switch.

3. **Fire Detection:**
   - Receive real-time fire detection alerts via the mobile app.

4. **Soil Moisture Monitoring:**
   - Monitor soil moisture levels using the mobile app.
   - Automatically water the farm based on soil moisture readings.

5. **Humidity and Temperature Monitoring:**
   - Track humidity and temperature levels in the farm environment.

## Main Components Used

- **ESP8266:** IoT module for wireless communication.
- **Arduino Uno:** Microcontroller for interfacing sensors and actuators.
- **Firebase:** Online database for real-time data storage.
- **MIT App Inventor:** Used for developing the mobile application.
